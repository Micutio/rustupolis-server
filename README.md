# rustupolis-server

A server implementation for the rustupolis library

Derived from work done on the rustupolis fork by Maxbever: [Tuple space in the fog](https://github.com/Maxbever/Tuple-space-in-the-fog)

This shall serve as a reference implementation for rustupolis. Those looking for a more actively developed and feature-rich implementation which also uses rustupolis in the backend are highly encouraged to refer to [LIF server](https://github.com/Maxbever/LIF_Server) by Maxbever.
